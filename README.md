# Regression-Analysis
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the total fare for taxi rides based on various factors such as trip duration, distance traveled, number of passengers,tips received, miscellaneous fees, and surge pricing.

Business Understanding
In the realm of taxi services, business users rely on data to optimize pricing strategies and enhance the customer experience. By leveraging the prediction of the total fare based on certain columns, they can make informed decisions. Here's how they utilize the following factors:

1)Trip Duration: Analyzing the duration of each journey provides insights into peak hours and demand patterns. Business users can adjust prices accordingly, offering discounts during slower times and maximizing revenue during busy periods.

2)Distance Traveled: Understanding the distance covered by each taxi ride helps estimate fuel consumption and maintenance costs. By optimizing pricing based on distance, taxi companies can ensure profitability while remaining competitive.

3)Number of Passengers: Recognizing the number of passengers in each ride is crucial for optimizing capacity utilization. Business users can adjust pricing based on group sizes, offering discounts for larger groups or providing premium services for solo travelers.

4)Tips Received: Tips indicate customer satisfaction and driver performance. Business users analyze tipping patterns to identify areas for improvement and incentivize drivers to provide exceptional service.

5)Miscellaneous Fees: Additional charges, such as toll fees or extra services, impact the overall fare structure. Business users track these fees to refine pricing models and ensure transparency in fare calculations.

6)Surge Pricing: Surge pricing, triggered by high demand, allows businesses to adjust prices accordingly. By predicting surge periods and applying surge pricing when needed, business users can balance revenue maximization with customer satisfaction.

By leveraging the prediction of the total fare and considering these factors, business users can optimize pricing strategies, attract customers, and create a positive customer experience. Their goal is to strike a balance between profitability and providing value to passengers in the competitive taxi industry.

Inferences 

1)Decision Tree (No Tuning): This model achieved the lowest MAPE on the training set (0.119723%), indicating a good fit to the training data. However, it also had a relatively higher MAPE on the test set (3.234282%), suggesting some degree of overfitting. The model's depth is 37, indicating a complex tree structure.

2)Decision Tree (GridSearchCV) and Decision Tree (RandomizedSearchCV): Both models obtained similar MAPE values on both the training and test sets, indicating a balanced performance. The MAPE on the training set is higher compared to the model without tuning, indicating a slight reduction in overfitting. The depth of these models is 20, suggesting a slightly less complex tree structure compared to the model without tuning.


3)Overall, the models with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV) performed better in terms of balancing the trade-off between fitting the training data and generalizing to the test data. The slight increase in training MAPE compared to the model without tuning suggests a trade-off for improved test set performance and reduced overfitting. The similar MAPE values between GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV indicate that the random search approach achieved comparable results to the exhaustive grid search.
